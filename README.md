# odin-recipes
First ever project
This is my very first project following the odin course

After I will finish this project I will be amazed by the fact that i actually can make a website

It will be a webpage about cooking, a recipes website to be accurate

My skills on this project are based on what i've learned about HTML

To be precise I will use commands like : lists (unordered and ordered) links to other pages , putting images and so on

I hope it wont take much time haha!
